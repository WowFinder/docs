# Abbreviations in code element names

As a rule of thumb, the use of full words for naming is preferred. There are some major categories in which the use of abbreviations is acceptable (sometimes even preferred), and those are documented here.

## Pathfinder standard abbreviations

Several game terms are commonly abbreviated in most Pathfinder materials (books, online documents, character sheets, etc), or in English usage in general. When these abbreviations can fit within the naming and casing conventions, they should be used. Some abbreviations that are normally presented in full uppercase should be avoided instead, and a list of preferred alternatives is included below.

- `misc`: Miscellaneous. Used for generic or undefined items or effects.

### Abbreviations to avoid (Pathfinder)

These abbreviations should be avoided as part of code element names. They are only widely used in their upper-case form, and this doesn't fit within the project's naming conventions. Note that usage of these outside of code elements (like in comments, user-facing text, documentation, etc) is perfectly fine.

- `AC`: Armor Class. Use `armorClass` instead.
- `BAB`: Base Attack Bonus. Use `baseAttack` instead.
- `CHA`: Charisma. Use `charisma` instead.
- `CMB`: Combat Maneuver Bonus. Use `maneuverBonus` instead.
- `CMD`: Combat Maneuver Defense. Use `maneuverDefense` instead.
- `CON`: Constitution. Use `constitution` instead.
- `DEX`: Dexterity. Use `dexterity` instead.
- `FF`: Flat-Footed. Use `flatFooted` instead.
- `HP`: Hit Points. Use `hitPoints` instead.
- `INT`: Intelligence. Use `intelligence` instead.
- `STR`: Strength. Use `strength` instead.
- `WIS`: Wisdom. Use `wisdom` instead.

## Technology abbreviations

Some abbreviations are so common in technology and/or software that using the full words would actually hinder readability. Here is a list of abbreviations in this category:
