# Github issue labels

For consistency, issues and pull requests should be labeled with the following labels accross all repositories. Before adding other labels to repositories, they should be included in this file.

Labels that are included by default by GitHub and not included in this list must not be used and should be removed. Labels that are in this list but differ in color and / or description should be updated to match the list.
